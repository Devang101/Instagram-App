This project is based off a youtube tutorial found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFO4Zr0EPE

The purpose of this project is to create a ruby on rails application similar to instagram. In this application users have accounts that they can sign into and logout from. If they don't have an account the application gives them the ability to register for one. Users can also post pictures to a feed and view these pictures from the index page.
